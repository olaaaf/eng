\noindent\textbf{Reinforcement learning for the Super Mario Bros. game}
The aim of this engineering thesis was to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning-based model capable of completing levels in the \textit{Super Mario Bros} game. The implementation utilized the Double Q-Learning algorithm, a convolutional neural network, and the Weights and Biases tool for experiment monitoring. The thesis analyzed the impact of training parameters, such as the discount factor, epsilon decay strategy, and reward function, on model performance. The results confirm that appropriate parameter tuning and a balanced reward function significantly enhance the algorithm's efficiency.
